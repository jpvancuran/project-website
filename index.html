                    <p> Hi, I'm Jeff VanCuran and I'm an up and coming software developer.
                        I live in Killeen, TX, which is only 45 minutes up the road from Austin. 
                        I have a strong passion for always trying to learn the next thing.
                        I never like to settle for where I am and always stive to be better
                        than I was yesterday. I want every single product that I put out to be the best.  </p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p> I am a strong team player, who is very driven. Both in and out of the workspace I 
                        always give 100%. In the workplace, I am always looking for the next thing to do.
                        Outside of the workplace, I am an ultra-marathon runner. I compete in distances from
                        50k to 100+ miles. That takes a lot of grit and determination, and I carry that work ethic
                        over into my coding as well. I never give up on a problem, no matter how hard it seems to be.
                        There is always a soution, I just have to find it. </p>
                    <p> Here is a list of the languages I am learning:</p>
                    <ul class='list'>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS</li>
                        <li>JavaScript</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Previous Employers Include:</p>

                <h3>Airbus A220</h3>
                    <p> I was a part of the initial launch of the A220 line in Mobile, Al. My team spent three
                        months in Mirabel, QC learning the process fomr our Canadian counter-parts in order to 
                        bring production to the US. As a Lead Systems Installer, I managed a group of 10-15 people
                        daily. This included distributing work, troubleshooting problems, ensuring that all work
                        was up to standard.  </p>

                <h3>Cessna Latitude</h3>
                    <p> The Cessna Latitude was where I got my start in aviation manufacturing. I worked in the
                        final assembly area. This is the last station before the aircraft goes out to paint. A lot
                        of the job included checking over things to make sure that all of the quality marks were 
                        met before it rolled out the door. This is where me being detail-oriented really came to
                        shine. </p>
