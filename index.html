                <h2>Stitching Together Innovative Software</h2>
                    <p> Hi, I'm Jeff VanCuran and I'm an up and coming software developer. I live in Killeen, TX, which is only 45 minutes up the road from Austin. I have a strong passion for always trying to learn the next thing. I never like to settle for where I am and always strive to be better than I was yesterday. I want every single product that I put out to be the best.  </p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a strong team player, who is very driven. I want to be a part of a leading-edge team that is constantly pushing the limits of what is possible. I love learning from others who have more experience than I do. I have always loved how coding works. The fact that we can take plain text and make it do real things on the screen is amazing to me. It is such a rush when I see the results of my coding on a website. I’m always looking for new things to learn about website designs and features. Both in and out of the workspace I always give 100%. In the workplace, I am always looking for the next thing to do. Outside of the workplace, I am an ultra-marathon runner. I compete in distances from 50k to 100+ miles. That takes a lot of grit and determination, and I carry that work ethic over into my coding as well. I never give up on a problem, no matter how hard it seems to be. There is always a solution, I just have to find it.
                    </p>
                    <p> Here is a list of the languages I am learning:</p>
                    <ul class='list'>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS</li>
                        <li>JavaScript</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Previous Employers Include:</p>

                <h3>Airbus A220</h3>
                    <p> I was a part of the initial launch of the Airbus A220 line in Mobile, Ala. This application controlled the way that some of the flight control systems communicated with the rest of the aircraft’s computers. This allows a seamless flow of information between aircraft systems and allows pilots to have all flight information one just one cockpit screen. My team spent three months in Mirabel, QC learning the process from our Canadian counterparts in order to bring production to the US. As a Lead Systems Installer, I managed a group of 10-15 people daily. This included distributing work, troubleshooting problems, ensuring that all work was up to standard. </p>

                <h3>Cessna Latitude</h3>
                    <p> The Cessna Latitude was where I got my start in aviation manufacturing. I worked in the final assembly area where I was working on programming a control mechanism for the dorsal intake. The dorsal intake controlled the flow of air into the climate control system for the aircraft by opening and closing the valve in relation to the amount of air flowing into it. The program that I worked on would take that airflow data and determine how much to manipulate the valve in order to maintain a consistent flow into the system. This is the last station before the aircraft goes out to paint. A lot of the job included checking over things to make sure that all of the quality marks were met before it rolled out the door. This is where me being detail-oriented really came to shine. </p>
